# Understanding CSS in Web Development

## Introduction
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is like the interior and exterior design of a website.
- HTML provides the structure of a webpage, while CSS defines its visual style.
- CSS has five key elements: selector, property, value, declaration block, and declaration.

## CSS Elements
- A CSS rule consists of a selector, property, and value.
- The selector specifies which HTML element to style (e.g., `h1` selects all heading one tags).
- A declaration block, enclosed in curly braces, contains style declarations.
- Declarations include properties and their corresponding values (e.g., `color: blue;`).

## Applying CSS
- CSS tells the web browser how to display HTML elements.
- A declaration block starts with an opening curly bracket `{` and ends with a closing curly bracket `}`.
- Selectors determine which elements are styled.
- You can apply styles to all elements of a type (e.g., `h1` selector) or specific elements with IDs.

## Real-time Styling with Live Preview
- The VS Code extension "Live Preview" allows real-time preview of changes in HTML and CSS.
- Install the extension and right-click your HTML file to select "Live Preview, Show Preview."

## Creating and Linking CSS
- Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and a CSS file (e.g., `style.css`).
- Link the CSS file to the HTML using the `link` tag with `rel` set to "stylesheet" and `href` pointing to the CSS file.

## Applying CSS Rules
- Use CSS rules to style elements.
- CSS follows precedence and specificity rules to determine which rule applies to an element.
- The most specific rule takes precedence over others (e.g., ID selector over HTML type selector).

## Recap
- CSS is crucial for web design, defining the visual style of web pages.
- CSS rules consist of selectors, properties, and values.
- The most specific CSS rule takes precedence when styling elements.
- Use "Live Preview" to see real-time changes in VS Code.
- Practice applying CSS rules to HTML documents to reinforce your understanding.
