# Understanding Block and Inline Elements in HTML

By now, you've learned how CSS styles individual HTML elements, but how does the web browser know where to place the elements on the screen? The web browser's normal way of calculating the position of HTML elements on the screen is called document flow. 

## Block Level Elements

By default, nearly all HTML elements are organized into one of two categories, namely block and inline elements.

- A block-level element will occupy the full horizontal width of its parent element and the vertical height of its content. Each block-level element will have a new line before and after. Therefore, multiple block-level elements will stack on top of each other like a stack of boxes.

Some examples of block-level elements include:
- `<div>`
- `<form>`
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)

## Inline Elements

- In contrast, inline elements only occupy the width and height of their content. They don't appear on a new line, hence the name "inline." Therefore, multiple inline elements can form a row of elements.

Common inline elements include:
- `<a>` (anchor)
- `<img>` (image)
- `<input>`
- `<label>`
- `<strong>` (bold)
- `<em>` (italics)
- `<span>`

## Demonstrating the Difference

Let's demonstrate the difference between block and inline elements using an example of an HTML file containing `<div>` and `<span>` elements.

```html
<div>
  <span>Text 1</span>
  <div>Text 2 (Block Element)</div>
  <span>Text 3</span>
</div>
