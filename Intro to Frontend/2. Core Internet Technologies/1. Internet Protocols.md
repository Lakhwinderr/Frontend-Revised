# Understanding Internet Protocols and IP Addresses

In this note, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of Internet Protocols, IP addresses, and how data is sent across the Internet.

## Introduction

- Email is a common communication method today, but it's interesting to draw parallels between how data is sent and received on the Internet and the traditional postal system.

## The Role of IP Addresses

- Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are crucial for data transmission across the Internet.
- They function much like postal addresses, enabling packets of information to reach their intended destinations.
- In this video, you'll learn about IP addresses and how data is sent across the Internet.

## Network Connectivity

- Computers connect to each other to form networks.
- These networks, in turn, connect to each other to create the Internet.

## Internet Protocols

- To enable data transmission, we use **Internet Protocols**, with version four (IPv4) and version six (IPv6) being the most widely used.
- Think of these protocols as addresses for computers on the network, much like postal addresses for letters.

## IP Address Formats

- In IPv4, an IP address consists of four octets, separated by periods or dots (e.g., 192.0.2.235).
- In IPv6, an IP address contains eight groups of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329).

## IP Packets

- Data is sent across a network as a series of messages called **IP packets**, containing a header and payload.
- The header includes the destination and source IP addresses, along with additional information for packet delivery.
- The payload contains the data and other protocols, which we'll discuss shortly.

## Addressing Data Problems

- Similar to the postal system, IP packets can face issues like arriving out of order, becoming damaged, or being lost during transit.
- To address these problems, packets include additional protocols within their payload.

## Common Protocols

- The two most common protocols are:
  - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Solves issues of data arriving out of order, getting damaged, or being lost, but with a slight delay.
  - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** Solves the corrupt packet issue but allows for packets to arrive out of order or not arrive at all.

## Further Protocols

- Both TCP and UDP can contain additional protocols within their payloads to ensure data integrity and delivery.

## Conclusion

The Internet functions using Internet Protocols, much like an old-fashioned postal system. These protocols work to ensure data arrives in order, remains uncorrupted, and doesn't get lost or dropped during transit. You've now gained insight into how IP addresses work and how data is sent across the Internet.
