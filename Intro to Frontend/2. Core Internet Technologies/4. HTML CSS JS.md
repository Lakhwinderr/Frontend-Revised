# Exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this note, we'll dive into the fundamental technologies that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three core technologies enable the creation of web pages and applications. We'll explore how they interact with each other through two practical examples.

## Introduction

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of web development.
- They work in tandem to create web content and interactivity.
- We'll examine two examples to understand their synergy.

## Example 1: Creating a Digital Clock

### HTML (clock.html)

- Defines the content for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Basic structure without styling.
- Represents time as six zeros (hh:mm:ss).

### CSS (styles.css)

- Provides styling for the clock.
- Specifies positioning, size, color, background, and fonts.
- Transforms the plain content into a digital clock.

### JavaScript (clock.js)

- Updates the content every second.
- Dynamically changes the hour, minute, and second elements.
- Completes the functionality of the clock.

## Example 2: Building an Interactive Video Player

### HTML (video.html)

- Describes the content, including a video element and a Play button.
- Basic structure without styling.

### CSS (video-styles.css)

- Applies styling to the video element and the Play button.

### JavaScript (videoplayer.js)

- Registers a listener on the Play button for click events.
- Checks the current state of the video (playing or stopped).
- Switches between play and stop icons based on video state.
- Creates an interactive video player.

## Summary

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are interconnected to create functional web applications.
- HTML defines content, CSS styles the content, and JavaScript provides interactivity.
- These technologies work together to bring web pages and applications to life.

Understanding how these three core technologies collaborate is essential for web development.
