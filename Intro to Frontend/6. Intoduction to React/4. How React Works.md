# How React Works

- **React Components and User Interfaces:**
  - React allows building components to develop user interfaces.
  - Components translate into elements on the web page.

- **Browser DOM and Updating:**
  - When a web browser receives an HTML page, it constructs a DOM (Document Object Model) to represent it.
  - Updating the DOM is considered expensive and time-intensive for the browser.

- **React's Solution: Virtual DOM**
  - React computes its own virtual DOM to address the inefficiency of updating the browser DOM.
  - Virtual DOM is a representation of the browser DOM kept in memory by React.

- **Virtual DOM Functionality:**
  - React uses the virtual DOM to update the browser DOM only when necessary.
  - Ensures fast and responsive applications.

- **Reconciliation Process:**
  - React compares HTML components in the virtual DOM with the browser DOM to determine changes (reconciliation).
  - Only changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.

- **Updating Components in React:**
  - Virtual DOM updated first.
  - React compares it with the previous version to identify changes.
  - Only changed elements updated in the browser DOM.

- **Conclusion:**
  - React's virtual DOM allows selective updating of HTML elements, enhancing performance by avoiding recreating the entire page.
