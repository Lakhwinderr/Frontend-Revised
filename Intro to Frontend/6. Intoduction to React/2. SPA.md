# Single Page Applications
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**
  - Offer user-friendly, mobile-friendly experiences.
  - Used in popular platforms like social networks, messaging apps, and map applications.
  - Provide unique, speedy, and engaging user experiences.
- **Traditional Websites vs. SPAs**
  - Traditional websites were multi-page applications, resource-intensive due to sending entire web pages for every request.
  - SPAs have only one HTML page sent from the server to the browser; content updates dynamically.
- **SPA Working Mechanism**
  - SPA updates content without downloading entire new web pages.
  - Browsing experience feels faster and more responsive.
- **Serving Code and Resources in SPAs**
  - Two approaches: bundling and lazy loading (code splitting).
  - Choice depends on application size, complexity, and bandwidth requirements.
- **Example: What to Watch Next Feature**
  - Traditional website: New web page returned with movie name.
  - SPA: JSON object returned, application updates to display movie name.
- **Example: Latest News and User Profile Pages**
  - Traditional website: Entire HTML page generated and sent back.
  - SPA: JSON object containing data (e.g., username, first name, last name) returned, HTML updated accordingly.
- **Considerations for Choosing SPA**
  - Assess website complexity to decide between traditional multi-page application or SPA.
  - SPA resource delivery methods: delivering all resources immediately or dynamically as required.
- **Performance Comparison**
  - Compare popular SPA websites to traditional ones to judge performance differences.
