# Static and Dynamic Content

- Websites provide personalized recommendations based on user profiles.
- Difference between static and dynamic content:
  - Static content: files transferred as stored (e.g., images, videos).
  - Dynamic content: generated upon HTTP request (e.g., user input, current date).
- Web server sends static content; application server generates dynamic content.
- Examples of static and dynamic content update processes.
- Application servers perform complex processing: application logic, database communication, permissions check.
- Specific application servers for various content types.
- Issue with dynamic content generation speed for large websites.
- Web server caching process:
  - Keeps a copy of dynamic content.
  - Checks cache for content before requesting from application server.
  - Reduces load on application server by serving cached content.
- Periodic update of cache with latest content.
