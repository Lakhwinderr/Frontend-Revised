# The Virtual DOM

React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM. As components are updated, React checks to see if the component’s HTML code in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.

## Reconciliation Process

As you know, this is called the reconciliation process and can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Step 1:** The virtual DOM is updated.
2. **Step 2:** The virtual DOM is compared to the previous version of the virtual DOM and checks which elements have changed.
3. **Step 3:** The changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.
4. **Step 4:** The displayed webpage updates to match the browser DOM.

## React Fiber Architecture

Even with this process, updating the browser DOM can be slow. The React team developed the React Fiber Architecture to address this issue. This architecture allows React to incrementally render the web page, optimizing when and where updates occur to the browser DOM. 

### How React Fiber Architecture Works

React prioritizes updates based on visibility to the user. Elements visible to the user are updated first (high priority changes), while elements not currently displayed are updated later (lower priority changes). This prioritization improves application performance and responsiveness to user input.

## Tools for Investigating React Processing

While you’re unlikely to interact with the virtual DOM and Fiber Architecture directly, tools like the official React Developer Tools web browser plugin developed by Meta are available. These tools help you investigate how React processes your webpage and diagnose issues during development.
