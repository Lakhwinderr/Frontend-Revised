# Planning Application Components in React

Planning an application as a series of components can be initially challenging, but it becomes more intuitive with practice. After learning about core Internet technologies, JavaScript libraries like React enable faster development of user interfaces.

## Component Hierarchy in React

- Every React application contains at least one component, the root component or app component.
- Components are added to the app component to form a tree structure, representing the application's components.

### Example: Shopping List Application

- Root component: App component.
- Child components: New Item Bar and Shopping List.
- Shopping List component contains Shopping Item child components for each item.
- Shopping Item component can be reused for displaying multiple items.

### Example: Blog Website

- Root component: App component representing the entire webpage.
- Child components:
  - Navbar component: Navigation bar with title, navigation links, and search component.
  - Page component:
    - Main Feature component: Displays a summary of a specific blog post.
    - Small Feature component: Displays blog summary and thumbnail image.
    - Small Feature component reused twice with different properties.

## Benefits of Component-based Development

- Reusability: Components allow code reuse for multiple sections of the website.
- Provides a clear and organized structure for building applications.
- Initially challenging, but becomes more efficient with experience.

## Conclusion

Planning component hierarchies in React may seem daunting initially, but with practice, it becomes a powerful tool for building efficient and maintainable applications. Good luck with your React development endeavors!
