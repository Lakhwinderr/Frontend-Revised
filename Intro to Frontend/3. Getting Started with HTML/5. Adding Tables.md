# Creating HTML Tables

## Introduction
- HTML tables are used to organize content in rows and columns.
- They are helpful for presenting structured information, such as price lists, schedules, or specifications.
- In this video, we will create a simple table to display the prices for "Little Lemon."

## Creating the Table
- Open the `index.html` page for your website.
- In the body element, below any existing content, add a `table` tag.
- Inside the `table` tag, add `tr` tags to create rows for each dish.
- Within each row, use `td` tags to define the content of table cells. Add one for the dish name and one for its price.

### Example:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Falafel</td>
    <td>$10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pasta Salad</td>
    <td>$12</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Adding Table Headers
- To make the table more organized, add headers to the columns.
- Create a new row at the top of the table using `tr` tags.
- Use `th` tags within this row to define the column headings, such as "Dish" and "Price."

### Example:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dish</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Falafel</td>
    <td>$10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pasta Salad</td>
    <td>$12</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Styling the Table
- To improve the table's appearance, add some basic styling using the `style` tag.
- For example, you can add a one-pixel border to the table to make it look more like a traditional table.

### Example:
```html
<style>
  table {
    border: 1px solid black;
  }
</style>
```

## Conclusion
- You have learned how to create HTML tables to organize and present structured information.
- Remember that this is just basic styling; you can enhance the table's appearance further using CSS best practices.
- Tables are a valuable tool for organizing data on your website.
