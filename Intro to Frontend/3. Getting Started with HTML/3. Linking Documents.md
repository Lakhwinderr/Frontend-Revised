# Creating Website Structure

In this video, we'll learn how to link different web pages together to create a website. Websites consist of multiple webpages linked using hyperlinks (anchor tags). Let's create a simple structure for our website.

## Adding a New Webpage

1. In your project folder, create a second webpage for "Little Lemon" that will contain the restaurant's address.
2. Right-click in the Explorer panel to create a new file and name it "location.html."
3. Use the same file structure as in "index.html" but add new content.

## Creating Content for "location.html"

1. Add an H1 tag for the heading, e.g., "Our Location."
2. Insert the address using a paragraph tag, e.g., "123 Rome Road, Main District, Capital City."
3. Save the file (Ctrl + S or Command + S on Mac).

## Linking Webpages

1. Return to "index.html" to add a link to "location.html."
2. Below the last paragraph tag, add an anchor (a) tag with the `href` attribute.
3. Specify the `href` attribute as "location.html" to link to the new webpage.
4. Within the anchor tag, add descriptive text, such as "Our Location," which will be displayed as a clickable link.

## Testing the Link

1. Save the file to update it with the changes.
2. Open "index.html" in your web browser by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Reveal in File Explorer" (or equivalent on Mac).
3. Double-click on the "index.html" file.
4. The text "Our Location" is displayed in blue by the web browser, indicating a successful link.
5. Clicking on the blue link opens the "location.html" file.

Now you can link different HTML files together to create your website. Best of luck with your website-building journey!
