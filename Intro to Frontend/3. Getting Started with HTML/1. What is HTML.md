# Notes on HTML Documents, Tags, and Elements

In this lesson, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of HTML documents, HTML tags, and HTML elements.

## HTML Documents: The Building Blocks

- Just like a building starts with a frame of beams and rafters, any web page begins with an HTML document.
- HTML documents serve as the basic structure of a web page and are assembled with various components like tags and elements.
- HTML documents typically have a .html suffix, and the initial page often goes by the name index.html.

## HTML Tags and Elements

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
- "Hypertext" refers to text containing links to other text, while "Markup" refers to the use of tags and elements within a document.
- HTML is a text file with a specific structure composed of elements and tags.

### HTML Tags

- Each HTML element consists of an opening tag enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., `<p>` for a paragraph.
- Most elements have paired closing tags, denoted with a forward slash, e.g., `</p>` for closing a paragraph.
- Elements usually contain content between their opening and closing tags, such as the text of a paragraph.

### Nesting Elements

- Elements can contain other elements, allowing you to create complex structures.
- For example, you can nest an `<i>` element inside a `<p>` element to make text appear in italics.

### Self-Closing Elements

- Some elements are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.
- An example is the line break tag: `<br>`, used to move content to the following line.

## HTML Standards

- HTML specifications define the rules and structure for elements and tags.
- These standards are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with the current version being HTML 5.
- HTML elements, with their opening and closing tags, build the structure of a web page and instruct the web browser on how to display content.

## Styling with CSS

- While HTML defines the structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control the presentation and appearance of web pages.
- CSS is crucial for making web pages visually appealing.
- You'll explore CSS in more detail in this course.

In summary, HTML tags and elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages. HTML documents provide structure, and by using appropriate tags and elements, you can create rich and engaging content for the web.
