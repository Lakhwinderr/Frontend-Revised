# HTML Document Structure

In this video, we'll explore the blueprint of an HTML document by creating a simple webpage for a restaurant called "Little Lemon." HTML documents don't require a web server to view them; you can save and view them locally on your computer. By the end of this video, you'll understand the structure of an HTML document and be able to create a basic webpage.

## Creating an HTML File

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click in the Explorer panel and select "New File."
3. Name the file "index.html."

## HTML Structure

- HTML documents consist of elements and tags.
- Start with a DOCTYPE declaration to notify the web browser that it's an HTML document.
- Next, create the HTML tag, which includes the head and body elements.

## Head Element

- The head element contains metadata about the HTML document.
- It doesn't appear in the webpage but provides essential information.
- Include a title element, displayed in the browser tab.
- Link to CSS files and define meta tags in the head section.

## Body Element

- The body element contains the visible content of the webpage.
- You can add elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos.

## Creating Content

- Start by adding a main heading using the H1 tag, e.g., "Our Menu."
- Create subheadings with the H2 tag for menu items, e.g., "Falafel" and "Pasta Salad."

## Viewing the Webpage

- Save the HTML file (Ctrl + S or Command + S on Mac).
- Open the file in your web browser to check the webpage's appearance.

## Adding Descriptions

- Below each subheading (H2), add descriptions using paragraph tags (p).
- For example, describe "Falafel" as "chickpea, herbs, and spices."
- Describe "Pasta Salad" as "lettuce, vegetables, and mozzarella."

## Exploring More HTML Tags

- Experiment with other HTML tags to enhance your webpages.
- Search for food website ideas online for inspiration.
- You've now learned some basic HTML tags, so start practicing and building your webpages.

Good luck with your HTML coding journey!
