So Dar~ That Door. Raag Aasaa, First Mehla:


One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:



Where is That Door of Yours, and where is That Home, in which You sit and take care of all? The Sound-current of the Naad vibrates there for You, and countless musicians play all sorts of instruments there for You. There are so many Ragas and musical harmonies to You; so many minstrels sing hymns of You. Wind, water and fire sing of You. The Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door. Chitr and Gupt, the angels of the conscious and the subconscious who keep the record of actions, and the Righteous Judge of Dharma who reads this record, sing of You. Shiva, Brahma and the Goddess of Beauty, ever adorned by You, sing of You. Indra, seated on His Throne, sings of You, with the deities at Your Door. The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing of You; the Saadhus sing of You in contemplation. The celibates, the fanatics, and the peacefully accepting sing of You; the fearless warriors sing of You. The Pandits, the religious scholars who recite the Vedas, with the supreme sages of all the ages, sing of You. The Mohinis, the enchanting heavenly beauties who entice hearts in paradise, in this world, and in the underworld of the subconscious, sing of You. The celestial jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, sing of You. The brave and mighty warriors sing of You. The spiritual heroes and the four sources of creation sing of You. The worlds, solar systems and galaxies, created and arranged by Your Hand, sing of You. They alone sing of You, who are pleasing to Your Will. Your devotees are imbued with Your Sublime Essence. So many others sing of You, they do not come to mind. O Nanak, how can I think of them all? That True Lord is True, forever True, and True is His Name. He is, and shall always be. He shall not depart, even when this Universe which He has created departs. He created the world, with its various colors, species of beings, and the variety of Maya. Having created the creation, He watches over it Himself, by His Greatness. He does whatever He pleases. No one can issue any order to Him. He is the King, the King of kings, the Supreme Lord and Master of kings. Nanak remains subject to His Will. ||1||

Aasaa, First Mehla:

Hearing of His Greatness, everyone calls Him Great. But just how Great His Greatness is-this is known only to those who have seen Him. His Value cannot be estimated; He cannot be described. Those who describe You, Lord, remain immersed and absorbed in You. ||1||


O my Great Lord and Master of Unfathomable Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence. No one knows the extent or the vastness of Your Expanse. ||1||Pausell All the intuitives met and practiced intuitive meditation. All the appraisers met and made the appraisal. The spiritual teachers, the teachers of meditation, and the teachers of teachers they cannot describe even an iota of Your Greatness. ||2||


All Truth, all austere discipline, all goodness, all the great miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas without You, no one has attained such powers. They are received only by Your Grace. No one can block them or stop their flow. ||3||


What can the poor helpless creatures do? Your Praises are overflowing with Your Treasures. Those, unto whom You give-how can they think of any other? O Nanak, the True One embellishes and exalts. ||4||2||

Aasaa, First Mehla:

Chanting it, I live; forgetting it, I die. It is so difficult to chant the True Name. If someone feels hunger for the True Name, that hunger shall consume his pain. ||1||

||2|| How can I forget Him, O my mother? True is the Master, True is His Name. ||1||Pausell Trying to describe even an iota of the Greatness of the True Name, people have grown weary, but they have not been able to evaluate it. Even if everyone were to gather together and speak of Him, He would not become any greater or any lesser. ||2||


That Lord does not die; there is no reason to mourn. He continues to give, and His Provisions never run short. This Virtue is His alone; there is no other like Him. There never has been, and there never will be. ||3|||

As Great as You Yourself are, O Lord, so Great are Your Gifts. The One who created the day also created the night. Those who forget their Lord and Master are vile and despicable. O Nanak, without the Name,they are wretched outcasts. |14||3|||

Raag Goojaree, Fourth Mehla:

O humble servant of the Lord, O True Guru, O True Primal Being: I offer my humble prayer to You, O Guru. I am a mere insect, a worm. O True Guru, I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be merciful, and bless me with the Light of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. II1||

O my Best Friend, O Divine Guru, please enlighten me with the Name of the Lord. Through the Guru’s Teachings, the Naam is my breath of life. The Kirtan of the Lord’s Praise is my life’s occupation. ||1||Pause||

The servants of the Lord have the greatest good fortune; they have faith in the Lord, and a longing for the Lord. Obtaining the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied; joining the Sangat, the Blessed Congregation, their virtues shine forth. ||2||

Those who have not obtained the Sublime Essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, are most unfortunate; they are led away by the Messenger of Death. Those who have not sought the Sanctuary of the True Guru and the Sangat, the Holy Congregation-cursed are their lives, and cursed are their hopes of life. ||3||

Those humble servants of the Lord who have attained the Company of the True Guru, have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed on their foreheads. Blessed, blessed is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, where the Lord’s Essence is obtained. Meeting with His humble servant, O Nanak, the Light of the Naam shines forth. ||4||4||

Raag Goojaree, Fifth Mehla:

Why, O mind, do you plot and plan, when the Dear Lord Himself provides for your care? From rocks and stones He created living beings; He places their nourishment before them. ||1||

O my Dear Lord of souls, one who joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is saved. By Guru’s Grace, the supreme status is obtained, and the dry wood blossoms forth again in lush greenery. ||1||Pausell Mothers, fathers, friends, children and spouses-no one is the support of anyone else. For each and every person, our Lord and Master provides sustenance. Why are you so afraid, O mind? ||2||

The flamingoes fly hundreds of miles, leaving their young ones behind. Who feeds them, and who teaches them to feed themselves? Have you ever thought of this in your mind? ||3||

All the nine treasures, and the eighteen supernatural powers are held by our Lord and Master in the Palm of His Hand.. Servant Nanak is devoted, dedicated, forever a sacrifice to You, Lord. Your Expanse has no limit, no boundary. ||4||5|||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of
The True Guru:

That Primal Being is Immaculate and Pure. The Lord, the Primal Being, is Immaculate and Pure. The Lord is Inaccessible, Unreachable and Unrivalled. All meditate, all meditate on You, Dear Lord, O True Creator Lord. All living beings are Yours-You are the Giver of all souls. Meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He is the Dispeller of all sorrow. The Lord Himself is the Master, the Lord Himself is the Servant. O Nanak, the poor beings are wretched and miserable! ||1||

You are constant in each and every heart, and in all things. O Dear Lord, you are the One. Some are givers, and some are beggars. This is all Your Wondrous Play. You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer. I know no other than You. You are the Supreme Lord God, Limitless and Infinite. What Virtues of Yours can I speak of and describe? Unto those who serve You, unto those who serve You, Dear Lord, servant Nanak is a sacrifice. ||2||

Those who meditate on You, Lord, those who meditate on You-those humble: beings dwell in peace in this world. They are liberated, they are liberated-those who meditate on the Lord. For them, the noose of death is cut away. Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord all their fears are dispelled. Those who serve, those who serve my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being of the Lord, Har, Har. Blessed are they, blessed are they, who meditate on their Dear Lord. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||3||


Devotion to You, devotion to You, is a treasure overflowing, infinite and beyond measure. Your devotees, Your devotees praise You, Dear Lord, in many and various and countless ways. For You, many, for You, so very many perform worship services, O Dear Infinite Lord, they practice disciplined meditation and chant endlessly. For You, many, for You, so very many read the various Simritees and Shaastras. They perform rituals and religious rites. Those devotees, those devotees are sublime, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to my Dear Lord God. ||4||


You are the Primal Being, the Most Wonderful Creator. There is no other as Great as You. Age after age, You are the One. Forever and ever, You are the One. You never change, O Creator Lord. Everything happens according to Your Will You Yourself accomplish all that occurs. You Yourself created the entire universe, and having fashioned it. You Yourself shall destroy it all. Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Dear Creator, the Knower of all ||5||1||


Aasaa, Fourth Mehia;

You are the True Creator, my Lord and Master. Whatever pleases You comes to pass. As You give, so do we receive. ||1||| Pausell All belong to You, all meditate on you. Those who are blessed with Your Mercy obtain the Jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs lose it. You Yourself separate them from Yourself, and You Yourself reunite with them again. ||1||

You are the River of Life; all are within You. There is no one except You. All living beings are Your playthings. The separated ones meet, and by great good fortune, those suffering in separation are reunited once again. ||2||

They alone understand, whom You inspire to understand; they continually chant and repeat the Lord’s Praises. Those who serve You find peace. They are intuitively absorbed into the Lord’s Name. ||3||


You Yourself are the Creator. Everything that happens is by Your Doing. There is no one except You. You created the creation; You behold it and understand it. O servant Nanak, the Lord is revealed through the Gurmukh, the Living Expression of the Guru’s Word. |14||2||

aasaa mahalaa pehilaa ||
Aasaa, First Mehla:

In that pool, people have made their homes, but the water there is as hot as fire! In the swamp of emotional attachment, their feet cannot move. I have seen them drowning there. ||1||


In your mind, you do not remember the One Lord-you fool! You have forgotten the Lord; your virtues shall wither away. ||1||Pause|| 1 am not celibate, nor truthful, nor scholarly. I was born foolish and ignorant into this world. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who have not forgotten You, O Lord! ||21|3||

aasaa mahalaa panjavaa ||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehla:


This human body has been given to you. This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe. Nothing else will work. Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; vibrate and meditate on the Jewel of the Naam. ||1||


Make every effort to cross over this Pause I have not practiced meditation, self-discipline, self-restraint or righteous living. I have not served the Holy; I have not acknowledged the Lord, my King. Says Nanak, my actions are contemptible! O Lord, terrifying world-ocean. You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of Maya. ||1|| I seek Your Sanctuary, please, preserve my honor! ||2||4||


There is one god, Waheguroo, Victory is his.


Written by the Sovereign King, Guru Gobind Singh Ji


Speech of the poet.

Chaupai


Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands all the desires of my heart be fulfilled. Let my mind rest under Thy Feet Sustain me, considering me Thine own.377.

Destroy, O Lord! all my enemies and protect me with Thine won Hands. May my family live in comfort and ease alongwith all my servants and disciples.378.

Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands and destroy this day all my enemies May all the aspirations be fulfilled Let my thirst for Thy Name remain afresh.379.

I may remember none else except Thee And obtain all the required boons from Thee Let my servants and disciples cross the world-ocean All my enemies be singled out and killed.380.


Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands and relieve me form the fear of death May Thou ever Bestow Thy favours on my side Protect me O Lord! Thou, the Supreme Destroyer.381.


Protect me, O Protector Lord! Most dear, the Protector of the Saints: Friend of poor and the Destroyer of the enemies Thou art the Master of the fourteen worlds.382.


In due time Brahma appeared in physical form In due time Shiva incarnated In due time Vishnu manifested himself All this is the play of the Temporal Lord.383.

The Temporal Lord, who created Shiva, the Yogi Who created Brahma, the Master of the Vedas The Temporal Lord who fashioned the entire world I salute the same Lord.384.

The Temporal Lord, who created the whole world Who created gods, demons and yakshas He is the only one form the beginning to the end I consider Him only my Guru.385.

I salute Him, non else, but Him Who has created Himself and His subject He bestows Divine virtues and happiness on His servants He destroys the enemies instantly.386.


He knows the inner feelings of every heart He knows the anguish of both good and bad From the ant to the solid elephant He casts His Graceful glance on all and feels pleased.387.


He is painful, when He sees His saints in grief He is happy, when His saints are happy. He knows the agony of everyone He knows the innermost secrets of every heart.388.


When the Creator projected Himself, His creation manifested itself in innumerable forms When at any time He withdraws His creation, all the physical forms are merged in Him.389.

All the bodies of living beings created in the world speak about Him according to their understanding But Thou, O Lord! live quite apart from everything this fact is know to the Vedas and the learned.390.

The Lord is Formless, Sinless and shelterless: He is the Primal Power, without Blemish, without Beginning and Unborn The fool claims boastfully about the knowledge of His secrets, which even the Vedas do not know.391.


The fool considers Him a stone, but the great fool does not know any secret He calls Shiva “The Eternal Lord, “but he does not know the secret of the Formless Lord.392

According to ones won intellect, one describes Thee differently The limits of Thy creation cannot be known and how the world was fashioned in the beginning?393.

He hath only one unparalleled Form He manifests Himself as a poor man or a king at different places He created creatures from eggs, wombs and perspiration Then He created the vegetable kingdom. 394.

Somewhere He sits joyfully as a king Somewhere He contracts Himself as Shiva, the Yogi All His creation unfolds wonderful things He, the Primal Power, is from the beginning and Self-Existent.395.


O Lord! keep me now under Thy protection Protect my disciples and destroy my enemies All the villains creations outrage and all the infidels be destroyed in the battlefield.396.

O Supreme Destroyer! those who sought Thy refuge, their enemies met painful death The persons who fell at Thy Feet, thou didst. remove all their troubles.397.

Those who meditate even on the Supreme Destroyer, death cannot approach them. They remain protected at all times Their enemies and troubles come to and end instantly 398.

Upon whomsoever Thou dost cast Thy favourable glance, they are absolved of sins instantly They have all the worldly and spiritual pleasures in their homes None of their enemies can even touch their shadow.399.

He, who remembered Thee even once, thou didst protect him from the noose of death Those persons, who repeated Thy Name, they were saved from poverty and attacks of enemies.400. khaRag ket mai saran tihaaree ||

O sword-wielder God! This all has been described by Thy Grace, what power can I have to write all this?.863.

DOHRA

O Lord! I have forsaken all other doors and have caught hold of only Thy door. O Lord! Thou has caught hold of my arm I, Govind, am Thy serf, kindly take (care of me and) protect my honour.864.

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:

I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found my True Guru. I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease, and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss. The jewelled melodies and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word of the Shabad. The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing the Shabad, Says. Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True Guru. ||1||

O my mind, remain always with the Lord. Remain always with the Lord, O my mind, and all sufferings will be forgotten. He will accept You as His own, and all your affairs will be perfectly arranged. Our Lord and Master is all-powerful to do all things, so why forget Him from your mind? Says Nanak, O my mind, remain always with the Lord. ||2||

O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your celestial home? Everything is in Your home, they receive, unto whom You give. Constantly singing Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind. The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose minds the Naam abides. Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your home? ||3||


The True Name is my only support. The tranquility to my mind, it has fulfilled all my desires. I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who possesses such glorious greatness. Says Nanak, listen, O Saints; enshrine love for the Shabad. The True Name is my only support. ||4||

The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate in that blessed house. In that blessed house, the Shabad vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it. Through You, we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny area attached to the Lord’s Name. Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current vibrates within their homes. ||5||

Pain, illness and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani. The Saints and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru.

Prays Nanak, touching the Guru’s Feet, the unstruck sound current of the celestial bugles vibrates and resounds. ||40||1||

Mundaavanee, Fifth Mehla:

Upon this Plate, three things have been placed: Truth, Contentment and Contemplation. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of our Lord and Master, has been placed upon it as well; it is the Support of all. One who eats it and enjoys it shall be saved. This thing can never be forsaken; keep this always and forever in your mind. The dark world-ocean is crossed over, by grasping the Feet of the Lord; O Nanak, it is all the extension of God. ||1||


Shalok, Fifth Mehla:

I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; only You can make me worthy. I am unworthy – I have no worth or virtues at all. You have taken pity on me. You took pity on me, and blessed me with Your Mercy, and I have met the True Guru, my Friend. O Nanak, if I am blessed with the Naam, I live, and my body and mind blossom forth. ||1||
