# Understanding Web Hosting

In this note, we'll explore the concept of web hosting and the various hosting options available for websites and web applications.

## Introduction to Web Hosting

- Websites and files are typically stored on web servers located in datacenters.
- But what if you want to create your own website? Do you need your own datacenter with specialized hardware and software?
- The answer is no. You can use **web hosting** to launch websites to the Internet.

## Web Hosting Service

- Web hosting is a service where you place your website and files on the hosting company's web server.
- You essentially rent space on their server in exchange for stable and secure storage.
- It's not limited to companies; individuals can also rent space for their websites.

## Types of Web Hosting

- There are various types of web hosting services, including:
  - **Shared Hosting**
  - **Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting**
  - **Dedicated Hosting**
  - **Cloud Hosting**

## Shared Hosting

- **Shared hosting** is the most affordable option.
- You share a web server with many other hosting accounts.
- Shared resources like processing power, memory, and bandwidth may affect performance.
- Suitable for small websites with minimal traffic or as a low-cost sandbox environment for practice.

## Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting

- **VPS hosting** offers dedicated CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources within a virtual server.
- Resources are fixed per VPS instance, reducing the impact of other instances.
- More expensive than shared hosting, ideal for sites with greater demands.

## Dedicated Hosting

- In **dedicated hosting**, you have a dedicated hardware server entirely to yourself.
- You have full control over hardware, CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources.
- Generally more expensive than VPS hosting.

## Cloud Hosting

- **Cloud hosting** is a scalable solution that spans across multiple physical and virtual servers.
- If one server fails, your website runs on another, ensuring uptime.
- You pay based on resource usage, allowing flexibility but potentially becoming more expensive.
- Ideal for websites and web applications that need to scale with popularity.
