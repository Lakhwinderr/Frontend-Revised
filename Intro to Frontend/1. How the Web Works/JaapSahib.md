The sacred utterance of The Tenth Sovereign:

CHHAPAI STANZA. BY THY GRACE

He who is without mark or sign, He who is without caste or line.

He who is without colour or form, and without any distinctive norm.

He who is without limit and motion, All effulgence, non-descript Ocean.

The Lord of millions of Indras and kings, the Master of all worlds and beings.

Each twig of the foliage proclaims: “Not this Thou art.”

(1)All Thy Names cannot be told. One doth impart Thy Action-Name with benign heart.1.
