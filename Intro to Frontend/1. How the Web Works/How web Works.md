# How the Internet Works

Hello and welcome! Have you ever found yourself searching for something online? It's amazing how quickly we can get responses from our searches, but have you ever wondered how it all happens? In this video, we'll explore the basics of how the Internet works.

## The Network

1. You open your favorite app on your device, and you're instantly connected to the world. This connectivity is made possible because devices connect and communicate via wired or wireless connections, forming what we call a network.

2. Multiple devices can be connected to this network, but it quickly becomes complex as each device needs to connect to every other device to communicate effectively.

3. The solution to this complexity is a device known as a "network switch." A network switch connects multiple devices and enables them to communicate with one another.

4. These network switches can also connect to other network switches, allowing multiple networks to interconnect.

5. Eventually, this interconnected network of networks forms what we commonly refer to as the Internet.

## Client-Server Model

1. The Internet provides us with various services, such as websites and video streaming. These services are made available by computers known as servers.

2. Our devices, like computers and smartphones, are called clients. This architecture is known as the "client-server model."

3. The Internet is the global network that connects clients and servers, facilitating communication and information exchange across the world.

## Global Connectivity

1. Have you ever had a video call with someone on another continent? The data for that video call travels through large undersea cables that connect the world's networks.

2. These undersea cables have the capacity to transfer enormous volumes of data every second, enabling global connectivity and communication.

3. There are many more technical details involved in making the Internet possible, but this overview should provide you with a general understanding of how it all works.

In conclusion, the Internet is a vast interconnected network that enables communication and information exchange on a global scale. It's an incredible technological achievement that has revolutionized the way we connect with the world. We hope this overview has given you a better understanding of how the Internet functions.
