The Lord is One and he can be attained through the grace of the True Guru.

Written by the Sovereign King, Guru Gobind Singh Ji

BY THY GRACE SWAYYAS

I have seen during my tours pure Sravaks (Jaina and Buddhist monks), group of adepts and abodes of ascetics and Yogi. Valiant heroes, demons killing gods, gods drinking nectar and assemblies of saints of various sects. I have seen the disciplines of the religious systems of all the countries, but seen none of the Lord, the Master of my life. They are worth nothing without an iota of the Grace of the Lord. 1.21.

With intoxicated elephants, studded with gold, incomparable and huge, painted in bright colours. With millions of horses galloping like deer, moving faster than the wind. With many kings indescribable, having long arms (of heavy allied forces), bowing their heads in fine array. What matters if such mighty emperors were there, because they had to leave the world with bare feet.2.22.

With the beat of drums and trumpets if the emperor conquers all the countries, Along with many beautiful roaring elephants and thousands of neighing houses of best breed. Such like emperors of the past, present and future cannot be counted and ascertained. But without remembering the Name of the Lord, they ultimately leave for their final abode. 3.23.

Taking bath at holy places, exercising mercy, controlling passions, performing acts of charity, practicing austerity and many special rituals. Studying of Vedas, Puranas and holy Quran and scanning all this world and the next world. Subsisting only on air, practicing continence and meeting thousands of persons of all good thoughts. But O King! Without the remembrance of the Name of the Lord, all this is of no account, being without an iota of the Grace of the Lord. 4.24.

The trained soldiers, mightly and invincible, clad in coat of mail, who would be able to crush the enemies. With great ego in their mind that they would not be vanquished even if the mountains move with wings. They would destroy the enemies, twist the rebels and smash the pride of intoxicated elephants. But without the Grace of the Lord-God, they would ultimately leave the world. 5.25.

Innumerable brave and mighty heroes, fearlessly facing the edge of the sword. Conquering the countries, subjugating the rebels and crushing the pride of the intoxicated elephants. Capturing the strong forts and conquering all sides with mere threats. The Lord God is the Commander of all and is the only Donor, the beggars are many. 6.26.

Demons, gods, huge serpents, ghosts, past. present and future would repeat His Name All the creatures in the sea and on land would increase and the heaps of sins would be destroyed. The praises of the glories of virtues would increase and the heaps of sins would be destroyed All the saints would wander in the world with bliss and the enemies would be annoyed on seeing them.7.27.

King of men and elephants, emperors who would rule over the three worlds. Who would perform millions of ablutions, give elephants and other animals in charity and arrange many svayyamuaras (self-marriage functions) for weddings. Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu and Consort of Sachi (Indra) would ultimately fall in the noose of death. But those who fall at the feet of Lord-God, they would not appear again in physical form. 8.28

Of what use it is if one sits and meditates like a crane with his eyes closed. If he takes bath at holy places upto the seventh sea, he loses this world and also the next world. He spends his life in such performing evil actions and wastes his life in such pursuits. I speak Truth, all should turn their ears towards it: he, who is absorbed in True Love, he would realize the Lord. 9.29.

Someone worshipped stone and placed it on his head. Someone hung the phallus (lingam) from his neck. Someone visualized God in the South and someone bowed his head towards the West. Some fool worships the idols and someone goes to worship the dead. The whole world is entangled in false rituals and has not known the secret of Lord-God 10.30.
