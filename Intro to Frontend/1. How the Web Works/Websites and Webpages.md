# Understanding Webpages and Websites

In this note, we'll explore the concepts of webpages, websites, and the core technologies that power them.

## Webpages vs. Websites

- A **web page** is a document that displays images, texts, videos, and other content in a web browser.
- A **website** is a collection of webpages that are interconnected.

## Interconnected Web

- When you visit a website, you typically start with the homepage, which contains links to different articles.
- Clicking on a link takes you to a new webpage or article.
- Webpages on the same website often have similar addresses in the browser, indicating their association.
- Links on webpages can also lead to other websites.

## Vastness of the Internet

- Thousands of websites are being launched on the internet while you're reading this.
- In a week, there are as many new webpages as there are stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza, which has 2.3 million blocks.
- With current internet speeds, it would take three million years to download all webpages on the internet.

## Core Technologies

- Webpages rely on three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** structures the content and uses markup tags to describe headings, paragraphs, images, and multimedia elements.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** adds visual enhancements, controls colors, and manages layout, commonly known as styling.
- **JavaScript** is a programming language that provides interactivity, data processing, and user interaction, making web pages dynamic and engaging.

## Interaction of Technologies

- HTML is like the building structure, CSS is the interior decoration, and JavaScript is the business and services.
- JavaScript is essential for actions like form validation and real-time content updates on web pages.

## Page Rendering

- When a web page is sent from the web server to your browser, each line of code is processed sequentially.
- The browser interprets the code, creating the visual representation on your screen.
- This process is known as **page rendering**.

## Conclusion

You've now gained insight into the essential technologies that underpin web pages and how they work together. You've also learned about the rendering process, where a web page's code is translated into what you see on your screen. With this knowledge, you're one step closer to becoming a web developer and contributing to the ever-growing internet.
