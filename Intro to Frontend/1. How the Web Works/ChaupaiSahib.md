Speech of the poet.

Chaupai

Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands

all the desires of my heart be fulfilled.

Let my mind rest under Thy Feet

Sustain me, considering me Thine own.377.

Destroy, O Lord! all my enemies and

protect me with Thine won Hands.

May my family live in comfort

and ease alongwith all my servants and disciples.378.

Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands

and destroy this day all my enemies

May all the aspirations be fulfilled

Let my thirst for Name remain afresh.379.

I may remember none else except Thee

And obtain all the required boons from Thee

Let my servants and disciples cross the world-ocean

All my enemies be singled out and killed.380.

Protect me O Lord! with Thine own Hands and

relieve me form the fear of death

May Thou ever Bestow Thy favours on my side


Thou, the Supreme Destroyer.381.

Protect me, O Lord! Thou, the Protector, O Lord !

Most dear, the Protector of the Saints:

Friend of poor and the Destroyer of the
enemies

Thou art the Master of the fourteen worlds.382.

In due time Brahma appeared in physical form

In due time Shiva incarnated

In due time Vishnu manifested himself

All this is the play of the Temporal Lord.383.

The Temporal Lord, who created Shiva, the Yogi

Who created Brahma, the Master of the Vedas

The Temporal Lord who fashioned the entire world

I salute the same Lord.384.

The Temporal Lord, who created the whole world

Who created gods, demons and yakshas

He is the only one form the beginning to the end

I consider Him only my Guru.385.

I salute Him, non else, but Him

Who has created Himself and His subject

He bestows Divine virtues and happiness on His servants

He destroys the enemies instantly.386.

He knows the inner feelings of every heart

He knows the anguish of both good and bad

From the ant to the solid elephant

He casts His Graceful glance on all and feels pleased.387.

He is painful, when He sees His saints in grief

He is happy, when His saints are happy.

He knows the agony of everyone

He knows the innermost secrets of every heart.388.

When the Creator projected Himself,

His creation manifested itself in innumerable forms

When at any time He withdraws His creation,


All the physical forms are merged in Him.389.

All the bodies of living beings created in the world

Speak about Him according to their understanding

But Thou, O Lord! live quite apart form everything

This fact is know to the Vedas and the
learned.390.

The Lord is Formless, Sinless and shelterless:

He is the Primal Power, Blemishlless, Behinningless and Unborn

The fool claims boastfully about the knowledge of His secrets,

which even the Vedas do not know.391.

The fool considers Him a stone,

but the great fool does not know any secret

He calls Shiva “The Eternal Lord,

“but he does not know the secret of the Formless Lord.392.

According to ones won intellect,

one describes Thee differently

The limits of Thy creation cannot be known

and how the world was fashioned in the beginning?393.

He hath only one unparalleled Form

He manifests Himself as a poor man or a king at different places

He created creatures from eggs, wombs and perspiration

Then He created the vegetable kingdom.394.

Somewhere He sits joyfully as a king

Somewhere He contracts Himself as

Shiva, the Yogi

All His creation unfolds wonderful things

He, the Primal Power, is from the beginning and Self-Existent.395.

O Lord! keep me now under Thy protection

Protect my disciples and destroy my enemies

All the villains creations outrage and all the infidels be destroyed in the battlefield.396.

O Supreme Destroyer ! those who sought Thy refuge, their enemies met painful death.

The persons who fell at Thy Feet, Thou didst remove all their troubles.397.

Those who meditate even on the Supreme Destroyer, the death cannot approach them
They remain protected at all times

Their enemies and troubles come to and end instantly.398.

Upon whomsoever Thou dost cast Thy favourable glance, they are absolved of sins instantly

They have all the worldly and spiritual pleasures in their homes

None of th enemies can even touch their shadow.399.

He, who remembered Thee even once, Thou didst protect him from the noose of death

Those persons, who repeated Thy Name, they were saved from poverty and attacks of enemies.400.

Bestow Thy help on me at all places and protect me from the designs of my enemies.401.

The Mother of the world has been kind towards me and I have completed the book this auspicious night

The Lord is the destroyer of all the sins of the body and all the malicious and wicked persons.402.

When Mahakal became kind, He immediately caused me to complete this book

He will obtain the fruit desired by the mind (who will read or listen to this book) and no suffering will occur to him.403.

The dumb, who will listen to it, will be blessed with the tongue to speak

The fool, who will listen to it attentively, will get wisdom

That person will be absolved of suffering, pain or fear,

Who will even once recite this Chaupai-prayer.404.

CHAUPAI

It was Bikrami Samvat 1753

SWAYYA

O God! the day when I caught hold of your feet, I do not bring anyone else under my sight

None other is liked by me now the Puranas and the Quran try to know Thee by the names of Ram and Rahim and talk about you through several stories,

The Simritis, Shastras and Vedas describe several mysteries of yours, but I do not agree with any of them.

O sword-wielder God! This all has been described by Thy Grace, what power can I have to write all this?.863.

DOHRA

O Lord! I have forsaken all other doors and have caught hold of only Thy door. O Lord! Thou has caught hold of my arm

I, Govind, am Thy serf, kindly take (care of me and) protect my honour.864.
